\begin{otherlanguage*}{english}

The objective of this work is to compare a diverse set of methods of machine learning and signal processing, analyzing the performance. To be able to understand how these factors affect the quality of the classification for a \acs{BCI}.
 The machine learning algorithms used for this work were \ac{SVM} and  \ac{ANN}. The signal processing methods used were \ac{PMTM}, \ac{PSDp} and \ac{PWelch}. The \ac{SVM} with a linear kernel was superior to all other machine learning methods.
